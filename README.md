This project analyzes the relationship between crypto prices (BTC, ETH, ADA) and the S&P 500, incorporating quantitative easing (QE) and tightening (QT) policies by examining the U.S. Federal Reserve's total assets.

Key methodologies include:
SQL (PostgreSQL) for data storage, cleaning, and analysis
Power BI for visualization and insights
Excel for data preprocessing and merging

Project Timeline & Key Steps
Step 1: Data Collection & Preparation
Collected historical price data for BTC, ETH, ADA, and S&P 500
Fetched Federal Reserve total assets data (from FRED)
Merged multiple CSV files in Excel
Ensured correct number formatting (avoiding E+11 notation issues)

Step 2: Database Setup (SQL Server)
Created two databases:

crypto_db (for BTC, ETH, ADA)
snp500_db (for S&P 500)
Designed a relational schema, linking both databases using timestamp
Imported cleaned CSV data into SQL tables

Step 3: SQL Analysis & Insights
Trend Analysis: Identified bull & bear markets using daily returns
Volatility Analysis: Compared price fluctuations across assets
Correlation Analysis: Measured BTC-S&P 500 correlation over time
Impact of QE & QT: Analyzed crypto price changes relative to Fed policies

Key SQL Challenge Solved:
Window function nesting error → Resolved by restructuring queries
Null correlation values → Fixed by removing rows with missing data

Step 4: Data Visualization in Power BI
Imported SQL data into Power BI
Fixed decimal issues & large number formatting (E+11)
Created interactive line charts:

Crypto prices over time
BTC, ETH, and ADA scaled correctly
Fed assets vs. Crypto prices
Added a secondary Y-axis to compare different scales

Step 5: Insights & Findings
1. Did QE drive crypto rallies?
   Strong correlation between Fed balance sheet expansion & BTC growth (2020-2021)
3. How did QT affect crypto?
   Declines in BTC & ETH prices during Fed tightening periods (2018, 2022)
5. Crypto vs. S&P 500
   Weak correlation in bull markets, stronger correlation in downturns
